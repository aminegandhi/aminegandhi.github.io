<h1>Ami Negandhi</h1>

<p>My name is Ami Negandhi. I am an artist and a teacher. This website is a sampling of the work that I have done over the past several years. You can contact me by email at ami@aminegandhi.com.</p>

<h2>Education & Career</h2>

<p>I have a diploma in commercial art from Mumbai’s reputed Nirmala Niketan. After a short stint with an advertising agency, I moved on to teaching at Girton High School, which is also my alma mater. I was approached by Shishuvan School a few months later and offered a role as an art teacher. In the four years that I spent with them since then, I helped lay out the art and craft curriculum for new grades being introduced each year.</p>

<p>At present, I teach at the Daffodil International School in Pune.</p>

<h2>Exhibitions</h2>

<p>In July 2007, I moved on from Shishuvan and returned back to my art, spending time working on my paintings and photographs and exploring artistic styles and techniques.</p>

<p>During this period, I held an exhibition on the theme of Ganesha with fellow-artist Khimand Joshi at Pune’s Sanskriti Lifestyle art gallery. I also participated with the team at Texity Systems for Spandan – An Art Beat, an exhibition of photographs and paintings. Spandan was held in support of Eklavya, a school for underpriviledged children.</p>
