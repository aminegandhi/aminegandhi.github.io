                        <p>My name is Ami Negandhi. I am an artist and a teacher. This website is a sampling of the work
                            that I have
                            done over the past several years. You can contact me by email at ami@aminegandhi.com.</p>
                        <h2>Education & Career</h2>
                        <p>I have a diploma in commercial art from Mumbai’s reputed Nirmala Niketan. After a short stint
                            with an
                            advertising agency, I moved on to teaching at Girton High School, which is also my alma
                            mater. I was
                            approached by Shishuvan School a few months later and offered a role as an art teacher. In
                            the four years
                            that I spent with them since then, I helped lay out the art and craft curriculum for new
                            grades being
                            introduced each year.</p>
                        <h2>Exhibitions</h2>
                        <p>In July 2007, I moved on from Shishuvan and returned back to my art, spending time working on
                            my paintings
                            and photographs and exploring artistic styles and techniques.</p>
                        <p>During this period, I held an exhibition on the theme of Ganesha with fellow-artist Khimand
                            Joshi at Pune’s
                            Sanskriti Lifestyle art gallery. I also participated with the team at Texity Systems for
                            Spandan – An Art
                            Beat, an exhibition of photographs and paintings. Spandan was held in support of Eklavya, a
                            school for
                            underpriviledged children.</p>
